\section*{Project Proposal}
We are doing the challenge presented \href{https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/deep-learning-challenge-2/machine-learning/yes-a-question/}{here}.

\section{Introduction}
	Disease type diagnosis from X-rays is of low-cost and simple. However, lack of experienced doctors and high miss misdiagnosed rates makes it a challenge. We are trying to solve this problem using deep learning as well as classical machine learning techniques, with over 10,000 labeled data.
	
    \subsection{Related Works}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Learning to Read Chest X-Ray Images from 16000+ Examples Using CNN \cite{dong2017learning}
        \end{itemize}

\section{Dataset}
We are using the dataset provided by hackerearth. The training data is split into two parts. One with X-ray pictures and disease labels. This other one includes general information of the patients, i.e., gender and age.

\section{Methodology}
We are planning to try different pre-trained models combined with out own self-defined layers. Apart from that, we are also planning to use general patient information as additional inputs 

\section{Outcome}
    Try to achieve over 75\% accuracy on test data, try to reach a score over 0.5 (Currently the best core is about 0.38).
